# sequelize-pg-utilities

[`Sequelize`](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize), and the [`Sequelize CLI`](https://github.com/sequelize/cli), use slightly different database configuration objects, and neither provide a mechanism for creating a [`Postgresql`](https://www.postgresql.org) database. I work with `Sequelize` a lot in my day-job so decided to write a simple utility suite that manages the different configuration needs any project using `Sequelize` inevitably needs.

When your application starts yo need to construct correct database configuration values as a mix of a config file, selected environment variables, and sensible defaults.

`sequelize-pg-utilities` is an opinionated set of database utilities that, together, simplify creating and connecting to a `Postgres` database via `Sequelize`, or the `Sequelize CLI`, via a common, and minimal, set of config file settings. You can use environment variables to override the config file settings, as well as supply a range of detailed programmatic settings that get passed on to Sequelize directly. If no values are supplied and a value is needed by Sequelize then this defines sensible defaults. Any values not needed and which have no value are simply removed from the config object sent to Sequelize.

## Prerequisites

This library assumes:

1. You are using NodeJS 8.10+
2. You are using [`Sequelize`](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize) to manage interactions with [`Postgresql`](https://www.postgresql.org)

## Install

Add `sequelize-pg-utilities` and [`pg`](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/tree/master/packages/pg) as dependencies:

```sh
npm i pg sequelize-pg-utilities
```

**Note**: `pg` is a peer-dependency of `sequelize-pg-utilities`.

## Usage Scenarios

### Configuration

Typically a Sequelize project will include a `config/config.json` file with entries as follows:

```json
{
  "development": {
    "username": "my-dev-user",
    "password": "my-dev-password",
    "database": "my-project-development"
  },
  "test": {
    "username": "my-test-user",
    "password": "my-test-password",
    "database": "my-project-test"
  },
  "production": {
    "username": "my-production-user",
    "password": "my-production-password",
    "database": "my-project-prod"
  }
}
```

When your application starts you'll need to construct correct database configuration values as a mix of the above config file, selected environment variables, and sensible defaults.

To do this simply create a configuration object as follows:

```js
const { configure } = require('sequelize-pg-utilities')
const config = require('path/to/config/config.json')

const { name, user, password, options } = configure(config)
```

These configuration values can then be passed in to Sequelize as follows:

```js
const sequelize = new Sequelize(name, user, password, options)
```

#### Environment Variables Supported

The following environment variables take precedence over whatever is defined in `config/config.json`

- `DATABASE_URL` The database url, if provided, will override many of the below `DB` settings.
- `DB_NAME` The database name — You may also supply a default (see below)
- `DB_USER` The database user — no default
- `DB_PASS` The database password — no default
- `DB_POOL_MAX` The maximum number of database connections — Defaults to `5`
- `DB_POOL_MIN` The minimum number of database connections — Defaults to `1`
- `DB_POOL_IDLE` The database idle time — Defaults to `10000` ms
- `DB_HOST` The database host — Defaults to `'localhost'`
- `DB_PORT` The database port — Defaults to `5432`
- `DB_TYPE` The database type — Defaults to `'postgres'` — This library is written with Postgres in mind so please don't change this unless you know what you are doing.

The following environment variables remain unset if they don't appear, or get set in `config/config.json`.

- `DB_POOL_ACQUIRE` The database pool's `acquire` value.
- `DB_POOL_EVICT` The database pool's `evict` value.

#### Regarding `DATABASE_URL`

If you supply the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, as Heroku and other PaaS systems generally do, then the `configure` function will extract most of what it needs from that and the extracted values will take priority over other values.

### Initialisation of a database

In `development` and `test` environments, you'll need your server to create a database the first time it runs. To do this you can make an `initialiser` using the `makeInitialiser` function.

```js
const { makeInitialiser } = require('sequelize-pg-utilities')
const config = require('path/to/config/config.json')

const initialise = makeInitialiser(config)

const start = async () => {
  try {
    const result = await initialise()
    console.log(result.message)

    // now do whatever else is needed to start your server
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Could not start server', err)
    process.exit(1)
  }
}
```

You can set the number of retries by passing it in as a parameter to `initialise`. The default is `5`.

```js
const result = await initialise(10)
```

On each retry it will wait for a progressively longer period of time, starting with 2 seconds, and increasing the delay by 2 seconds each retry.

The `result` object has two properties:

```js
{
  dbNew: false, // or true if a new database was created?
  message: 'More information' // some clarifying text.
}
```

In `production` it assumes your database already exists.

### Configuring migrations

The Sequelize CLI requires a `.sequelizerc` file at the root of the project that exports data such as `config`, `migrations-path`, and `models-path`.

The `config` required by the Sequelize CLI is an object in the form:

```js
{
  [env]: {
    username,
    password,
    database,
    dialect,
    host,
    port,
    // optionally also the following
    pool: {
      acquire: 20000,
      evict: 15000,
      min: 5,
      max: 15,
      idle: 10000
    },
    protocol,
    ssl: {
      rejectUnauthorized: false,
      ca: 'some-root-cert',
      key: 'some-client-key',
      cert: 'some-client-certificate'
    }
  }
}
```

Use the `migrationConfig` function to generate configuration details to suit Sequelize CLI's needs from your common `config` file, or environment variables.

Create a `migrationConfig.js` file as follows:

```js
const { migrationConfig } = require('sequelize-pg-utilities')
const config = require('path/to/config/config.json')

module.exports = migrationConfig(config)
```

Then in `.sequelizerc` file do this:

```js
const path = require('path')

module.exports = {
  config: path.resolve(__dirname, 'path', 'to', 'migrationConfig.js'),
  'migrations-path': path.resolve(__dirname, 'migrations'),
  'models-path': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src', 'models')
}
```

### Function Signature

The `configure`, `makeInitialiser`, and `migrationConfig` functions all have an identical signature.

They each accept the following parameters.

- `config`: The content of the `config/config.json` file. Required, no default.

  Configuration file is in the form:

  ```js
  {
    [env]: {
      // everything is optional but these are usually set here
      username,
      password,
      database,
      dialect,
      host,
      port,
      // less often used but optionally also the following
      benchmark,
      clientMinMessages,
      native,
      omitNull,
      pool: {
        acquire: 20000,
        evict: 15000,
        min: 5,
        max: 15,
        idle: 10000
      },
      protocol,
      // if you have ssl specifics
      ssl: {
        rejectUnauthorized: false,
        ca: 'some-root-cert',
        key: 'some-client-key',
        cert: 'some-client-certificate'
      },
      replication,
      timezone
    }
  }
  ```

- `defaultDbName`: If the database name is not set in an environment variable, and if the config file does not define a database name, then use this as the database name. Optional, no default.
- `logger`: You can pass in a logger function here for Sequelize to use. Optional, default is `false`, meaning don't log anything. This gets returned as `logging` in the configs.
- `options`: optional additional configuration that is passed through to Sequelize.

  These match to the options listed at [sequelize/sequelize/lib/sequelize.js#126](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/blob/master/lib/sequelize.js#L126), which at the time of this writing are:

  - `dialectModule`,
  - `dialectModulePath`,
  - `define`,
  - `query`,
  - `schema`,
  - `set`,
  - `sync`,
  - `quoteIdentifiers`,
  - `transactionType`,
  - `typeValidation`,
  - `hooks`,
  - `pool.validate`,
  - `retry.match`,
  - `retry.max`

  Other additional options are ignored.

### SSL Options

If you supply `ssl` options in your `config.json` file then these will be injected into your configuration as `dialectOptions` and the `ssl` option will be set to `true`.

Note this is not used by `makeInitialiser` as it's assumed that you are only using `ssl` in `production` and you won't be trying to create your database from within your code when in `production`. A future release may address that however.
